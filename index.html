        <h2>History of the Grand Canyon</h2>
        <p>The Grand Canyon is located in northern Arizona and is believed to have formed 5-6 <em>million</em> years ago! The canyon has been inhabited ever since the last Ice Age. It's also one of the biggest canyons in the world, being measured at 270 miles long, 18 miles wide, and a mile deep. The first Europeans reached the Grand Canyon in the 1540s. After being protected by President Benjamin Harrison, the canyon became a United States National Park in 1919.</p>
